# GP3ThirdPerson

Basic third person shooter prototype, made as an exercise. 
For this project I used some asset that are not included here.

To Make it work properly:
- Import Paragon Character Wraith from Fab: https://www.fab.com/listings/17e0840f-8651-4933-bd6d-211a34b1dd17
- Make a socket on the weapon_r bone of the Wraith skeletal mesh called WeaponSocket
- Import a mesh for the weapon, assign it to the BP_Gun Blueprint
